# KubeVirt SIG Failure Report Summary

This document provides a summary of the failing tests for each Special Interest Group (SIG) in the KubeVirt project. The information is based on the latest reports generated by the CI system.

## SIG Compute

The SIG Compute report shows a variety of failures across different areas, including VM lifecycle, migrations, and infrastructure components.

**Common Failures:**
- **Timeouts:** Many tests are failing due to timeouts, particularly when waiting for Virtual Machine Instances (VMIs) to reach the `Running` state. This suggests potential issues with scheduling or resource allocation.
- **Live Migration:** Several live migration tests are failing, especially in scenarios where the target pod fails during the migration process. This indicates a potential lack of resilience in the migration logic.
- **Infrastructure:** There are failures related to the cluster profiler, virt-handler rate limiting, and node health checks, pointing to potential instability in the underlying infrastructure components.
- **Test-specific issues:** Some failures appear to be specific to certain test environments or configurations, such as CPU pinning, soft reboot, CPU hotplug, and persistent TPM.

- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.32-sig-compute-1.6`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.34-sig-compute-arm64`

## SIG Storage

The SIG Storage report highlights issues related to live migration, VM snapshots, and hotplug volumes.

**Common Failures:**
- **Live Migration:** Tests involving the cancellation of live migrations are consistently failing with timeouts.
- **VM Snapshots:** Online VM snapshot tests are failing because the agent is not connecting within the expected time.
- **Hotplug Volumes:** VMI migration with hotplug volumes is failing due to timeouts.
- **fstrim:** Tests related to `fstrim` are also timing out.

**Failing Jobs:**
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.33-sig-storage-1.6`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.34-sig-storage`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.32-sig-storage-1.6`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.34-sig-storage-1.7`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.33-sig-storage`

## SIG Network

The SIG Network report shows failures related to interface state and network connectivity.

**Common Failures:**
- **Interface State:** A test that checks the interface state during migration is failing with a timeout while waiting for the agent to connect.
- **Masquerade Binding:** A test for masquerade binding is failing because it cannot reach an external address (`google.com`).
- **IPv6:** An IPv6 test with masquerade binding is timing out.

**Failing Jobs:**
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.34-sig-network`

## SIG Operator

The SIG Operator report indicates problems with updating and reconciling KubeVirt components.

**Common Failures:**
- **KubeVirt Updates:** Multiple tests that update KubeVirt from a previous release are failing with timeouts because the control-plane components are not becoming ready.
- **Reconciliation:** A test for reconciling daemonsets is failing with a timeout while waiting for the resource to revert to its original state.

**Failing Jobs:**
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.34-sig-operator`
- `pull-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.33-sig-operator-1.6`

## SIG Monitoring

The SIG Monitoring report shows no failing tests.
