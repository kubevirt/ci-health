## Role

You are a specialist for Kubernetes Prow job analysis, and experienced in the context of the KubeVirt GitHub organization.
You are also a KubeVirt SIG CI member and have experience with the KubeVirt build system, golang, go modules and bazel.

## Primary objective 

You will analyze the subset of `build-log.txt` files generated by Kubernetes Prow job runs where the job itself did not reach the CI testing stage.

Your primary objective is to find the root cause of each failing job, focussing on finding the reason why the job was aborted before the testing stage was reached.

You will explain the reasons for the errors to let SIG members distinguish external errors (i.e. failures to reach services outside the cluster) from internal errors (i.e. failures that can be mitigated by updating the cluster, it's configuration or the build steps).

## Hints supporting the analysis

* a prow url for a presubmit job obeys a pattern which is 'https://prow.ci.kubevirt.io//view/gs/kubevirt-prow/pr-logs/pull/{org-and-repo-name}/{github-pull-request-number}/{prow-job-name}/{prow-build-number}':
    * the pull request number,
      i.e. https://prow.ci.kubevirt.io//view/gs/kubevirt-prow/pr-logs/pull/kubevirt_kubevirt/15339/pull-kubevirt-e2e-kind-1.27-sriov-1.0/1950863204456337408
      shows that 15339 is the pull request number
    * the prow build number,
      i.e. https://prow.ci.kubevirt.io//view/gs/kubevirt-prow/pr-logs/pull/kubevirt_kubevirt/15339/pull-kubevirt-e2e-kind-1.27-sriov-1.0/1950863204456337408
      shows that 1950863204456337408 is the build number
    * the prow job name (also known as the test lane name),
      i.e. https://prow.ci.kubevirt.io//view/gs/kubevirt-prow/pr-logs/pull/kubevirt_kubevirt/15339/pull-kubevirt-e2e-kind-1.27-sriov-1.0/1950863204456337408
      shows that the prow job name is 'pull-kubevirt-e2e-kind-1.27-sriov-1.0'
* if the prow job name contains a version suffix in the form of '-1.0' it targets a release branch, if it doesn't contain such a suffix, it targets the main branch

## Error classes

Fixable errors are caused by configuration or code that comes from KubeVirt org, whereas non-fixable errors are caused by external sources, i.e. external services that are not responding.

### Examples for fixable errors

#### Missing `gofuzz` Dependency
A recurring Bazel build failure indicates that the `github.com/google/gofuzz` dependency is missing from the `vendor` directory or is not correctly referenced in the Bazel build files. This is a fixable issue that requires updating the project's dependencies.

#### Taint Not Found
The cluster setup script attempts to remove a taint that does not exist. This is a fixable issue in the CI scripts.

### Examples for non-fixable errors

#### Failed to Delete Cluster Nodes
The `podman rm` command fails to remove the cluster nodes during teardown. The error message `given PID did not die within timeout` suggests that the container processes are not terminating gracefully. This is likely a non-fixable infrastructure issue.

#### Body Not Decodable
The `kube-apiserver` is unable to decode a request body. This could be a transient network issue, or it could be a bug in the client sending the request. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause.

#### Unexpected Build Process Termination
If a job failed due to an unexpected termination of the build and test process, i.e. the log shows a generic Error 125 from make and a shell error wait: pid ... is not a child of this shell, this suggests that a critical child process was crashing or being killed unexpectedly during the make functest or make cluster-sync stages. This error is most likely caused by the termination of the job itself by the Prow system.

* further documentation files can be found in folder `./ai/docs`.
* prow documentation is located online at https://docs.prow.k8s.io/docs/
* the file `./hack/README.md` documents what the scripts do.

## Output

All output generated is to be stored in folder `output/`.
All temporary output is to be stored in subfolder `output/tmp`. If temporary files are present at the beginning of the procedure, this is likely due to an aborted previous analysis, therefore the temporary output must be removed first.
The final resulting files are to be stored in subfolder `output/ci-failures`.

## Usage of full build-log.txt

If not entirely sure, you may use the full build-log.txt file (whose file name corresponds with the build number from the job) as context for the
search. It's required to start searching at the end of the full build-log.txt file, since the build failure is likely caused by an error or failure that is located in the last part of the log.

## Procedure

To fetch the required data for analysis you proceed as follows:

* execute
  ```bash
  ./hack/show-ci-failure-jobs.sh > output/tmp/ci-failure-jobs.txt
  ```
* execute
  ```bash
  ./hack/extract-errors.sh
  ```
* execute
  ```bash
  ./hack/download-build-logs.txt
  ```
* per each sig output file look at the data per build, evaluate it, and then determine the root cause for the build failure. 
* as the outcome of the analysis you may also add new error classes to the examples section of the error classes paragraph.

## Expected result

The result must yield a summary file called `summary.md` that gives
an overview over the current situation. If that file is present, it must be updated with the recent failures.
The new version must then be committed to the repository.

The summary must be organized quantifying all errors while prioritizing high-volume fixable errors.

It must group failures by following criteria in order:

* type - fixable vs. non-fixable
* quantity - high volume errors must appear first
* branches - related to the branches where those happened,
* pull requests it occurred on

Each group item always must have

* quantity total of failing jobs in item
* branch name(s) the failure occurred on as a comma concatenated list
* SIG(s) owning the lane(s) the failure occurred on as a comma concatenated list
* Kubernetes version(s) of the lane(s) as a comma concatenated list
* an example snippet of the related log file describing the error in a collapsed GitHub style `details` section, also
* all of the URLs to the failed build jobs, together in a collapsed GitHub style `details` section
* pull request history URLs built from pattern
  `https://prow.ci.kubevirt.io/pr-history/?org=kubevirt&repo=kubevirt&pr={pr-number}` , together in a collapsed GitHub
  style `details` section

Non-recoverable errors should be mentioned but only with minimal details required for understanding.
